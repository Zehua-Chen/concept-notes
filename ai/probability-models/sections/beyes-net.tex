\section{Beyes Net}

  Beyes net is usually used to capture causal structure.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item When a node has two parent, only one needs to be true for the
    node to be true
    \item Independent varaibles/nodes do not have any connection
    on the graph
  \end{itemize}

  \subsection{Child-Parent Relationship}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{One parent}: two parameters
      \item \textbf{Multiple parent}: joint table
    \end{itemize}

    Given $ n $ variables, max number of parent is $ m $, there are
    $ n \times 2^{m} $ parents

  \subsection{Background Knolwedge}

    \subsubsection{Partial Order}

      \ul{Only some} of the elements in the collection is ordered

      \begin{itemize}
        \item Can linearize a partial order into a total order
      \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Total Order}

      \ul{Everything} in the collection is orderered.

  \subsection{Formal Description}

    Beyes net is a \ul{directed, acyclic} graph
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Partial ordered
      \item No cycles
    \end{itemize}

    Each node is conditionally independent of its ancestors
    given its parents.
