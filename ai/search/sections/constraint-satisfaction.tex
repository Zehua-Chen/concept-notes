\section{Constraint Satisfaction}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Result matters; path does not matter
    \item Need to find a goal state path doesn't matter
    \item Goal means passes some tests
  \end{itemize}

  \subsection{N Queens}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Given n x n board and n queens, place so that no queen threathens others
      \item \ul{Approach}: each col is a variable; variable values are
      rows (\ul{domains}); exactly one queen per column
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Constraints are interactions between values for different variables
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

  \subsection{Map Coloring}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Have k colors
      \item Color each sate
      \item Adjacent states must have different colors
      \item 4 color theorem
    \end{itemize}

  \subsection{NP Complete Problem}

    Best known algorithm is exponential, but we can't prove there isn'
    a polynomial algorithm. In practice,
