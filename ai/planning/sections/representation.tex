\section{Representation}

  \subsection{State}

    \begin{equation}
      \text{open}\left( \text{fridge} \right)
    \end{equation}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item States are represented using predicates chained together with operator.
      \item Predicates take states as objects
    \end{itemize}

  \subsection{Action}

    \begin{equation}
      \text{Take-out}\left( \text{butter}, \text{fridge} \right)
    \end{equation}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Actions takes objects are arguments
      \item \textbf{Preconditions}: logical conditions required for an action
      to happen
      \item \textbf{Effects (postconditions)}: changes the action makes to the
      state of the world
      \item Pre/Post condition determines how actions can be fitted into the
      plan and encode some limited knowledge about the meaning of each action
    \end{itemize}
