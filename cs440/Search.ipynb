    "\n",
    "- There should be a start state and a goal state;\n",
    "- States can be built on-demand (speech recognizer);\n",
    "- State content:\n",
    "    - Cost so far;\n",
    "    - Informed search only: estimate cost of the remaining search;\n",
    "- Types of states:\n",
    "    - Not yet seen;\n",
    "    - **Frontier**: seen, but not looked at neighbor;\n",
    "    - Done;\n",
    "\n",
    "## Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "- Loops\n",
    "- Large state space (get lost)\n",
    "- Large number of alternatives (get lost)\n",
    "- Can't see \"the entire world\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Search\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each state has a pointer to the previous state on the best path;\n",
    "    - In recursion, might not need the pointer\n",
