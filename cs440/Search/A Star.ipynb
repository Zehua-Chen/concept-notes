    "- Implementation is same as Uniform Cost Search, **except `g(s)` is replaced with `f(s)`** to order the priority queue\n",

    "    - Fast to compute\n",
    "    - Underestimate, aka **admissible heuristic** (lower bond), ex. take straight line\n",
    "    - As large as possible without overestimating\n",
    "- Simplfy problems:\n",
    "    - Remove walls\n",
    "    - Straighten out the roads\n",
    "    - Manhatten distance: $\\left| \\Delta x \\right| + \\left| \\Delta y \\right|$; (**this is a better solution when we can't move diagnally; if we can this is no longer an underestimate**)\n",

    "\n",
    "Many common heuristics are consistant . e.g. straing line in 2d geometry of his consistent, updates are only to states in frontiers. UCS in A* with (ha) = 0, h (s) is consistent.\n",
