# Three Point Light System

Three point light system produces beautiful effect and is easy to set up; it
consists of the following lights

- **Key light**: the main light
- **Fill light**: the dimmest light; required to soften the shadow casted by the
  key light
- **Rim light**: the brightest light; casted from the back of the object,
  producing an light rim around the edge of the object
  - Make sure the rim light is not too bright so that it blends the object with
    the background
