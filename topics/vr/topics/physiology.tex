\chapter{Human Physiology and Perception}

\section{Proprioception}

  The ability to sense the relative positions of parts of our bodies and
  the amount of muscular effort being involved in moving them.

\section{Vection}

  \textbf{Vection} is the illusion of self motion

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Eyes think the body is moving
    \item Balancing organs says otherwise
  \end{itemize}

\section{Adaptation}

  The perceived effect of stimuli changes over time

  \begin{itemize}
    \item FPS players experience less vection in VR
  \end{itemize}

\section{Stevens's Power Law}

  \textbf{Stevens's power law} characterizes the \textbf{exponential} relationship
  between the increase of intensity of stimulus and the perceived magnitude
  increase in sensation created by the stimulus

\section{Just Noticeable Difference (JND)}

  This is the amount that the stimulus needs to be changed so that subjects
  would perceive it to have changed in at least 50 percent of trials.

\section{Vergence Accommodation Mismatch}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Eyes are accommodating to the screen distance
    \item Eyes converge to some virtual depth
    \item Active area of research
  \end{itemize}

\section{Comfort}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Trials are essential
    \item Need consistent \textbf{90 FPS}
  \end{itemize}

\section{Eye Movement}

  \subsection{Saccades}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Rapid movement}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item 45ms
        \item Rotatino covers 900 degrees per second
      \end{itemize}

      \item Quickly relocates fovea to important features in scene
      \item Can be consciously controlled
    \end{itemize}

  \subsection{Vestibulo Occular Reflex (VOR)}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Involuntary movement of hte eye to counter head movement
      \item Provides image stablization
    \end{itemize}

  \subsection{Others}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Smooth Pursuit
      \item Optokinetic
      \item Vergence
      \item Microsaccadess
    \end{itemize}

\section{Implications for VR}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Sptial resolution
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Retina display}: 326 pixels per linear inch
      \item Low resolutions causes:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Aliasing
        \item Screen door effect
      \end{itemize}

      \item \textbf{Cycle per degree}: number of stripes that can be seen
      as separate along a viewing arc of 1 degree
      \item VR needs 2291.6 PPI to achieve 30 cycles per degree
      \item \textbf{Field of view} maximum human field of view is around
      270 degrees; how does a human achieve that FOV without head movement?
      \item \textbf{Foveated Rendering} draw the region of the scene the fovea
      is looking at a higher resolution; draw everything else on a lower
      resolution
      \item \textbf{VOR Gain} is a ratio between the eye rotation rate and
      the rotation and translate rate of the head
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Brain will adapt VOR to different optics (happen to people with
        glasses)
        \item Also happens with bad VR displays (increases happiness with VR
        experience; requires eyeadjustments outside VR)
      \end{itemize}

      \item \textbf{Display Scanout}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Rolling scanout: updating pixels line by line
        \item For 60FPS, could take up to 16.67 ms
      \end{itemize}

      % TODO: Rewatch last part of lecture
    \end{itemize}
    \item Intensity resolution
    \item Temporal resolution
  \end{itemize}
