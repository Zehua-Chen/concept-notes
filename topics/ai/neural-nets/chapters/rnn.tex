\chapter{Recurrent Neural Networks (Layers)}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \ul{Each \textbf{time stamp}}:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \ul{Produce two outputs}: an output, and a state
    \item \ul{Takes two inputs}: an input and a previous state
    \item \ul{Loss is calculated from prediction}
  \end{itemize}

  \item May have a number of time stamps in on execution of the layer
  \item Total loss is accmulated through time
  \item Can be think of as a state machine
  \item All neurons are fully inter-connected
  \item Back-propogate through time
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Hard to train
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Sentence processing}: A time stamp is executed
  for every word
\end{itemize}

\section{Gating}

  \paragraph{Problem} signals from one time stamp run decay over time;
  \ul{decay too fast for linguistic applications}

  \paragraph{Solution} uses a gating vector that controls what is
  forgotten and how fast; \ul{popular implementations}:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item LSTM
    \item Long short term memory
    \item GRU (Gold recurrent unit)
  \end{itemize}

\section{Design}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Typically very shallow
    \item Can have non-linear processing attached at the end of one
  \end{itemize}

\section{Execution}

\section{Bidirectional RNN}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Two RNN working in opposite directions
    \item Generate a summary output from the output from the two networks
    \item Use the same loss to optimize both networks
  \end{itemize}

\section{Linguistic Application}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item
    \item \textbf{Bidirectional RNN}
  \end{itemize}
