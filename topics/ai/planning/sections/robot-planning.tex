\section{Robot Planning}

  \subsection{What is a Good Path}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Reaches goal
      \item Resonably short
      \item Less obstacles
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Clearance from obstacles
      \end{itemize}

      \item Smooth (sharp paths are hard to do and damaging to the robots)
    \end{itemize}

  \subsection{Visibility Graph}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item States/Way points are vertices of objects
      \item Edges are straight line connecting vertices
      \item Not very safe
    \end{itemize}

  \subsection{Generalized Voronoi Diagram}

    Creating paths that are at the center of the free space

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Safe paths
      \item A bit long
      \item Does not work with higher dimensions
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Implementation}

      \begin{itemize}
        \item Create vertical cuts along the map
        \item Use the center point of each vertical line segment
        (segment created by obstacles)
      \end{itemize}
