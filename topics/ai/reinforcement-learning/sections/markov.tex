\section{Markov Decision Process}

  Different actions would result in differnet scores, and the
  goal of the agent is to accumulate the most points

  MDP specification contains

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Set of states}: $ s \in S $
    \item \textbf{Set of actions}: $ a \in A $
    \item \textbf{Reward function}: $ R\left( s \right) $
    \item \textbf{Transition function}: $ P\left( s' | s, a \right) $;
    the transition function gives us the \ul{probability that
    given a state $ s $, and an action $ a $, we moving into state $ s' $}
    \item \textbf{Policy function / solution}: $ \pi\left( s \right) $;
    \ul{commands the agent what to do given a state $ s $}
  \end{itemize}

  \subsection{Reward Function}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Can have any pattern of positive or negative values
      \item A few states has big rewards or negative consequences
      \item The rest of the states have some background reward (ex.
      constant across all of these background states)
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Impact of Reward Function}

      \begin{itemize}
        \item If background reward is high, \ul{agent has no motivation
        for high reward states}
        \item If background reward is low (more negative), \ul{agent
        has more motivation for high reward states}
      \end{itemize}

  \subsection{A Good Policy}
