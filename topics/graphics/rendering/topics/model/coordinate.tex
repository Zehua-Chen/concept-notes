\section{Coordinate System}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Units do not have specific meanings
  \item Left, right handed coordinate systems only differ in the direction of
  positive z and x axis
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Left}: positive z points away from the viewer; positive x on
    the right
    \item \textbf{Right}: positive z points toward the user; positive x on the
    left
  \end{itemize}

  In either coordinate, depth tests prioritize vertices closer to the viewer
\end{itemize}
