# Remove Friction

- **Load time**:
  - Only load what's needed
  - Async loading
  - Use profiling tools
- **Downloading assets**:
  - Don't make the player wait
- **Registration**:
  - Bypass ID
  - Automate using Vendor ID
  - Explain benefits
  - Defer until needed
- **Avoid startup configuration**
- **Ask for rating**
  - Don't ask during the first play

## Background Transfers

- Segment assets
  - Especially good for linear progression games

# Be a Good Teacher

- Teach by playing
- Show primary mechanic
- Introduce concepts one at a time
- Provide tip in context
- Give help along the way

# Tune Core Loop

- Center on target audience
- Make it easy to understand
- Steer each phase into next
- Make iteration meaningful
- Question your assumptions
- Every game is different

## Loop

```
Action -> Reward -> Expansion -> (Loop)
```

- Should have more than one core loop

## User Interaction

- Adopt to the interaction on platform
- Reinforce using feedbacks
  - Visual cue
  - Audio cue

### Touch Interaction

- **Interactions**:
  - Touch, tap
  - Gestures, swipes
  - Panning, paths
- **Feedbacks**: `Feel -> See -> Hear -> (Loop)`
