Mostly high level concept notes. For my notes of programming languages and
various frameworks/tools, follow these links

- [Framework Notes](https://github.com/Zehua-Chen/framework-notes.git)

## Project Structure

- `samples`: sample codes
- `shared`: shared files across topics
- `topics`: different topics

### Sample Codes

Whenever possible, sample code should be written in C# for the following reasons

1. Easy to debug
2. Awesome editor support
3. Cross platform
